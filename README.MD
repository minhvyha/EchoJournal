# 🎙️ EchoJournal (Week 1)

Welcome to **EchoJournal**, the very first project of my **10 Apps in 10 Weeks** challenge!

I am challenging myself to build 10 unique apps in 10 weeks to sharpen my full stack skills and share my progress with the community.

## 🌟 The "Why"

Most mood tracking apps require you to type out your feelings. While that is great for some, it can be a real barrier during "low energy" mental health days or depressive episodes when even holding a phone to type feels like a lot.

**EchoJournal** is built for accessibility. It lets you speak your mind, transcribes your thoughts in real time, and uses AI to "color" your entry based on your sentiment. No typing, no database, just you and your thoughts in the moment.

## ✨ Features

* **Voice-to-Text:** Real-time transcription using the Web Speech API.
* **AI Sentiment Analysis:** Instant analysis of your words via Hugging Face.
* **Dynamic UI:** The background color shifts based on your mood (e.g., cloudy grey for low sentiment to sunny yellow for positive vibes).
* **Privacy First:** No data is stored. This is a fast, ephemeral space for reflection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS
* **AI Logic:** Hugging Face Inference API (implemented directly in the frontend)
* **Transcription:** Web Speech API
* **Deployment:** Vercel
